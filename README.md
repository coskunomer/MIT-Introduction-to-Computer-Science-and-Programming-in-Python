---My Solutions to the PS Assignments---

Please note that these solutions are not the official ones. 
They are my own solutions I wrote to improve my Python skills in the first couple of weeks I started coding in Python.
Therefore, they are likely to contain some(maybe a lot) minor errors and bugs.
However, I believe that they can be helpful to understand the basic concepts and the logic behind the exercises.
